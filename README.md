# The what

The goal of this project is to create a **Ping Pong** ranking system for
the WU16 class at Yrgo.

# The how

The application will start off by asking the user to initiate a new game.
The user will then be prompted to submit the number of players in the current round.
This will (eventually) create x number of input fields or drop-down-lists for users to enter their names.(On a different page)
Once all names have been entered, users will be redirected to the "Game On" page where a named button will appear for each player.

The first player to get 'Tre prickar' will then go click the button with hens name on it. This will award the player with 1 point.
The second player to lose will receive 2 points when clicking hens button and so on.
The winner of the round will recieve 1 point for each player participating plus an additional 2 points for being awesome.

Feel free to pitch in with anything you want.
